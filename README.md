# Customer Churn Prediction Project

## About the Project
This project focuses on predicting whether a customer is likely to leave
a service or not. Customer churn prediction helps companies understand
customer behavior and take actions to retain customers.

The project uses historical customer data and machine learning
classification techniques to predict churn.


## Objective
- Analyze customer data to find churn patterns
- Build a model to predict customer churn
- Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics


## Dataset
- **Dataset:** Telecom Customer Churn Dataset
- **Source:** Kaggle  
- **Link:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn

The dataset contains customer information such as demographics,
services used, and churn status.


## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn


## How to Run
1. Install required libraries  
2. Run the main file  



## Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest


## Result
The model was able to identify customers who are likely to churn with
good accuracy.


## Conclusion
This project helped me understand how customer data can be used to
predict churn and how machine learning models are applied to
real-world business problems.
